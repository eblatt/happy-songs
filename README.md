What song features predict happiness of a country? What song features are more popular/are liked the most by the happiest countries?

In this project, we plan to merge data on happiness by country and top Spotify songs per country from 2017 in order to answer these questions. So far, we've worked on merging the data based on country code. We plan to use a random sample of about 25 of the top 200 songs from a select number of countries, in order to cut down on some of the data. We will implement a supervised learning algorithm for our predictions and find correlations between happier countries and higher values of certain song features. We may use this data to do a sentiment analysis of top songs by region and measure how consistent it is with our happiness data. We eventually plan to present this data in a map-like visualization.


Raw:

data.db- In this file, we have the database of every region's 200 top songs for every day for the year 2017. We plan to add information regarding the audio features of each song to this database by using Spotify's API. We found the data at https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking/version/3. 

world_happiness_report.csv- In this file, we have the happiness rankings of 155 countries. We found the data at https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness. 

country_codes.csv = In this file, we have country names along with their country codes. We found the data at https://datahub.io/core/country-list#resource-country-list_zip

We started off by trying to do a k-means clustering on 20 random songs that have two features-- a feature of the song(energy, loudness, etc.) and the happiness score of the country where that song was the top daily song. One initial hypothesis we were working with was that higher energy and louder songs would correlate with lower happiness countries as they would use energetic music as an outlet//escape. We ended up not finding any strong correlations, as you can see in the visualizations below.

Next, we tried a multiple linear regression analysis instead. We looked at the features with the lowest p values and highest coefficients, and we played around with analyzing different combinations of features. We mostly found that no feature's presence or absence altered our results//helped us better predict happiness as much as speechiness' did. See results below.

Challenges that we're facing and how we're moving forward:
  1) So far, the hardest part of the project has been handling very large datasets. One dataset that we are using has 53 countries top 200 daily songs for everyday of the year 2017-- thatâ€™s more than 2 million rows. We then had to merge that with the features we found for those songs using the Spotify API. Deciding how many of the data points we actually want to use has been an ongoing struggle. For example, we had trouble deciding whether we should choose top songs randomly or pick the top 10 daily songs rather than 200. Also, when we tried to visualize the data, there were way too many datapoints, so we have to decide new ways of visualizing this data in meaningful ways. 
   2) Spotify is not available in a lot of the countries with the lowest happiness scores, therefore we don't have a lot of the data on the least happy countries' top songs. We had to take data from the countries that have lowest scores OUT of the countries that Spotify does have data on. This means that the differences in scores between the top happy and lowest happy countries are not as large as we would have wanted.
   3) We have been concerned about but have not yet had to tackle directly is whether or not we will actually be able to make a sound conclusion. Social science research tends to have a low R-squared value, meaning that the model does not explain much of the variability in the data. Happiness is not a measurable thing, so finding a way to interpret the data in a meaningful way when there are many other variables that impact the output seems like it will be a daunting task.
